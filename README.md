    <h1>Learning Java ðŸš€</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Learning Java</strong> repository!</p>
    <p>
        This repository is my personal space for exploring, practicing, and improving my Java programming skills. 
        As a Computer Science enthusiast and an aspiring developer, I'm diving deep into Java and Data Structures 
        & Algorithms (DSA) to strengthen my understanding and problem-solving abilities.
    </p>
    <h2>ðŸŒŸ What's Inside</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Java Concepts:</strong> Code snippets and exercises on topics like OOP, data types, control statements, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Programs:</strong> Hands-on programs to solidify my understanding of Java fundamentals.</li>
        <li><strong>DSA Problems & Concepts:</strong> Solutions to various DSA problems, along with implementations of data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and algorithms like sorting and searching.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Challenges solved using Java to enhance my analytical and logical thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploring Libraries & APIs:</strong> Experimenting with Java libraries, frameworks, and APIs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To gain a solid foundation in Java.</li>
        <li>To master object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.</li>
        <li>To improve my problem-solving skills through DSA.</li>
        <li>To build efficient and optimized solutions to coding problems.</li>
        <li>To prepare for real-world Java development projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ðŸ’» Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OOP Concepts in Action:</strong> Examples showcasing abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
        <li><strong>DSA Implementations:</strong> Classic data structure implementations and solutions to common algorithmic problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Code Practices:</strong> Implementation of concepts like data hiding, modular code, and clean code principles.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Progress:</strong> Regular additions and updates as I progress in my Java and DSA journey.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ðŸš§ Work in Progress</h2>
    <p>
        This repository will be continuously updated as I learn new concepts, tackle challenging DSA problems, and explore advanced Java topics.
